%             Input file to stretch and then rotate a hyperelastic bar, meshed with 2 elements.
%             A user-subroutine is used to prescribe the rotation boundary condition (quite tricky)

    MESH

%    The NODE command defines properties of the nodes.  
%    The parameters are # of coords, # of DOF, and an optional integer identifier
       NODES
%    The parameters are # of coords, # of DOF, and an optional integer identifier
       PARAMETERS, 3, 3, 3001
%      Specify which nodal DOF are displacements.  In the example, DOF 1 is the x displacement, 2 is the y displacement, 3 is the z displacement
       DISPLACEMENT DOF, 1, 2, 3
%    Enter x,y,z coords of nodes.   The node number is optional, and is ignored in the code.
